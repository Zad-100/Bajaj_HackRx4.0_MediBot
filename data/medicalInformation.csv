In early 2020, Â the World Health Organization identified SARS-CoV-2 as a new type ofÂ coronavirus. The outbreak quickly spread around the world. Â It can affect your upper respiratory tract (sinuses, nose, and throat) or lower respiratory tract (windpipe andÂ lungs).It spreads the same way other coronaviruses do, mainly through person-to-person contact. Infections range from mild to deadly.SARS-CoV-2 is one of seven types of coronavirus, including the ones that cause severe diseases like Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and sudden acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The other coronaviruses cause most of the colds that affect us during the year but aren't a serious threat to otherwise healthy people.Is there more than one strain of SARS-CoV-2?Yes, the COVID-19 virus continues to mutate and there are several variants that are now spreading. Some are more contagious as well as more deadly than the original virus.Â  Throughout the pandemic, scientists have kept a close eye on variants like:AlphaBetaGammaDeltaEpsilonEtaIotaKappaOmicronN/AMuZetaHow long will the coronavirus last?There's no way to tell how long the pandemic will continue. There are many factors, including the public's efforts to slow the spread, researchers' work to learn more about the virus, their search for a treatment, and the success of theÂ vaccines.Symptoms of COVID-19The main symptoms include:FeverÂ CoughingShortness of breathTrouble breathingFatigueChills, sometimes with shakingBody achesHeadacheSore throatCongestion/runny noseLoss of smell or tasteNauseaDiarrheaThe virus can lead toÂ pneumonia, respiratory failure, heart problems, liver problems,Â septic shock, and death. Many COVID-19 complications may be caused by a condition known as cytokine release syndrome or a cytokine storm. This is when an infection triggers your immune system to flood your bloodstream with inflammatory proteins called cytokines. They can kill tissue and damage your organs.Â In some cases, lung transplants have been needed. If you notice the following severe symptoms in yourself or a loved one, get medical help right away:Trouble breathingÂ or shortness of breathOngoingÂ chest painÂ or pressureConfusionCan't wake up fullyBluish lips or faceStrokes have also been reported in some people who have COVID-19. Remember FAST:Face.Â Is one side of the person's face numb or drooping? Is their smile lopsided?Arms.Â Is one arm weak or numb? If they try to raise both arms, does one arm sag?Speech.Â Can they speak clearly? Ask them to repeat a sentence.Time.Â Every minute counts when someone shows signs of a stroke. Call 911 right away.If you're infected, symptoms can show up in as few as 2 days or as many as 14. It varies from person to person.According to researchers in China, these were the most common symptoms among people who had COVID-19:Fever 99%Fatigue 70%Cough 59%Lack of appetite 40%Body aches 35%Shortness of breath 31%Mucus/phlegm 27% Some people who are hospitalized for COVID-19Â also have dangerous blood clots, including in their legs, lungs, and arteries.What to do if you think you have itIf you live in or have traveled to an area where COVID-19 is spreading:If you don't feel well, stay home.Â Even if you have mild symptoms like a headache and runny nose, stay in until you're better. This lets doctors focus on people who are more seriously ill and protects health care workers and people you might meet along the way. You might hear this called self-isolation. Try to stay in a separate room away from other people in your home. Use a separate bathroom if you can.Call the doctor if you have trouble breathing.Â You need to get medical help as soon as possible. and go to the emergency room.Test yourself or get tested. Home testing kits are available which can help confirm your infection and let you know when it is safe to be around others. Local health officials and their online portals can also advise you where to go for testing and treatment.Follow your doctor's advice and keep up with the news on COVID-19.Â Between your doctor and health care authorities, you'll get the care you need and information on how to prevent the virus from spreading. For more information about COVID-19,Â see our FAQ.How do I know if it's COVID-19, a cold, or the flu?Symptoms of COVID-19 can be similar to aÂ bad coldÂ or the flu.

Find Out if You Have Symptoms of Coronavirus (COVID-19)See what to do about your symptoms and whether to call a doctor


Is COVID-19 worse than the flu?Unlike the flu, a lot of people aren't immune to the coronavirus, and because it has been mutating with new strains. If you do catch it, the virus triggers your body to make things called antibodies. Researchers are looking at whether the antibodiesÂ give you protection against catching it again.The coronavirus has caused higher rates of severe illness and death than the flu. But the symptoms themselves can vary widely from person to person.Is COVID-19 seasonal like the flu?While scientists hoped initially thatÂ higher temperatures and humidity levels might help slow the spread of the coronavirus, that was not the case. Experts advise caution and say thorough public health efforts have more influence than weather on the spread.Â  Also, past flu pandemics have happened year-round.Causes of the New CoronavirusResearchers aren't sure what caused it, and investigations as to its origin are ongoing. There's more than one type of coronavirus. They're common in people and in animals including bats, camels, cats, and cattle. SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is similar to MERS and SARS. They all came from bats.Coronavirus Risk FactorsAnyone can get COVID-19, and most infections are mild. The older you are, the higher your risk of severe illness.You also a have higher chance of serious illness if you have one of these health conditions:Chronic kidney diseaseChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)A weakened immune system because of an organ transplantObesitySerious heart conditions such as heart failure or coronary artery diseaseSickle cell diseaseType 2 diabetesConditions that could lead to severe COVID-19 illness include:Moderate to severe asthmaDiseases that affect your blood vessels and blood flow to your brainCystic fibrosisHigh blood pressureA weakened immune system because of a blood or bone marrow transplant, HIV, or medications like corticosteroidsDementiaLiver diseasePregnancyDamaged or scarred lung tissue (pulmonary fibrosis)SmokingThalassemiaType 1 diabetesDepressionAnxietySchizophreniaSome children and teens who are in the hospital with COVID-19 have an inflammatory condition that doctors are calling multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. Doctors think it may be linked to the virus. It causes symptoms similar to those of toxic shock and of Kawasaki disease, a condition that causes inflammation in kids' blood vessels.How Are Mood Disorders Linked to Severe COVID-19?If you have preexisting mood disorders, you may be at high risk for hospitalization or death but not necessarily severe COVID-19.That said, having schizophrenia is the biggest risk factor for besides age for COVID mortality. Those with schizophrenia spectrum disorders are prone to metabolic syndrome, which includes increased blood pressure, high blood sugar, and is associated with systemic inflammation. All of which is exacerbated by COVID.Mood and anxiety disorders were not connected to the higher risk, but people living with mental health conditions may have certain symptoms that can interfere with their ability to care for themselves and be engaged in their health decisions. This can make it hard to effectively follow health behaviors like maintaining social distancing or staying in quarantine to reduce the spread of the infection. Moreover, people with mental health and mood disorders are also more likelyÂ to have conditions like diabetes and heart problems which are major risk factors for severe COVID-19.There are also several socio-economic reasons why preexisting mood disorders can increase your chances of hospitalization and death if you get COVID-19.This includes:PovertyLack of access to preventative health careAbility to understand health recommendationsLack of access to affordable health careLiving in tight spaces or facilities like nursing homes, homeless shelters, prisons, or psychiatric inpatient unitsCoronavirus TransmissionHow does COVID-19 spread?COVID-19 mainly spreads from person to person.Â People release respiratory fluids during exhalation (e.g., quiet breathing, speaking, singing, exercise, coughing, sneezing) in the form of droplets across a spectrum of sizes. These droplets carry viruses and transmit infection.Â The largest droplets settle out of the air rapidly, within seconds to minutes.Â The smallest very fine droplets, and aerosol particles formed when these fine droplets rapidly dry, are small enough that they can remain suspended in the air for minutes to hours.The risk of transmission is greatest within three to six feet of an infectious source where the concentration of these very fine droplets and particles is greatest. If you breathe them in or swallow them, the virus can get into your body. Some people who have the virus don't have symptoms, but they can still spread the virus.While less likely, you can also get the virus from touching a surface or object the virus is on, then touching your mouth, nose, or possibly your eyes. Most viruses can live for several hours on a surface that they land on. OVID-19 can last for several hours on various types of surfaces:Copper (pennies, teakettles, cookware): 4 hoursCardboard (shipping boxes): up to 24 hoursPlastic (milk containers, detergent bottles, subway and bus seats, elevator buttons):2 to 3 daysStainless steel (refrigerators, pots and pans, sinks, some water bottles): 2 to 3 daysThat's why it's important to wash or sanitize your hands regularly and disinfect surfaces to get rid of the virus. Some dogs and cats have tested positive for the virus. A few have shown signs of illness. There's no evidence that humans can catch this coronavirus from an animal, but it appears it can be passed from humans to animals.What is community spread?Doctors and health officials use this term when they don't know the source of the infection. With COVID-19, it usually refers to someone who gets the virus even though they haven'tÂ been exposed to someoneÂ who has COVID-19.In February 2020, the CDC confirmed a COVID-19 infection in California in a person who had not traveled to an affected area or been exposed to someone with the disease. This marked the first instance of community spread in the U.S. It's likely that person was exposed to someone who was infected but didn't know it. This type of occurrence has been happening with the variants as well.How fast is it spreading?The number of people infected or re-infected by COVID-19 changes every day. See our news story for the latest updates on this developing story. How contagious is the coronavirus?The transmission rate is relatively high. Early research has estimated that one person who has it can spread it to between 2 and 3.5 others. By comparison, one person who has the seasonal flu will pass it to between 1.1 and 2.3 others.The Omicron variant, which is now the dominant strain of COVID-19 in the United States, is highly contagious and spreads faster than the original virus.Â The CDC reports there is evidence COVID-19 can be transmitted if you get within 6 feet of someone who is infectious for a total of 15 minutes throughout a day.Â We can work to lower the transmission rate byÂ wearing high-quality face masks when we can't stay 6 feet away from others,Â washing hands often, keeping common surfaces clean, limiting contact with other people, and getting vaccinated.Can coronavirus be transmitted through groceries, packages, or food?You're much more likely to get COVID-19 from another person than from packages, groceries, or food. If you're in a high-risk group, stay home and use a delivery service or have a friend shop for you. Have them leave the items outside your front door, if you can. If you do your own shopping, wear a high-quality face mask and try to stay at least 6 feet away from other shoppers. Wash your hands for at least 20 seconds before and after bringing things into your home. The coronavirus can linger on hard surfaces, so clean and disinfect countertops and anything else your bags has touched. You can wipe down plastic, metal, or glass packaging with soap and water if you want.There's no evidence that anyone has gotten COVID-19 from food or food containers.Coronavirus DiagnosisCall your doctor or local health department if you think you've been exposed and have symptoms like:Fever of 100 F or higherCoughTrouble breathingHome testing has advanced considerably since the beginning of the pandemic and you can readily test yourself.Â Otherwise, testing facilities are readily available in most areas.Â While some require an appointment, others are simply drive-up. Home testing kits are also widely available.A swab test is the most common testing method. It looks for signs of the virus in your upper respiratory tract. You or the person giving the test puts a swab up your nose to get a sample from the back of your nose and throat. That sample usually goes to a lab that looks for viral material, but some areas may have rapid tests that give results in as little as 15 minutes. If there are signs of the virus, the test is positive. A negative test could mean there is no virus or there wasn't enough to measure. That can happen early in an infection. It usually takes 24 hours to get results, but the tests must be collected, stored, shipped to a lab, and processed.The FDA has granted authorizations for several at-home nasal swab tests, which you collect yourself and express ship back to the lab for analysis as well as at-home rapid tests. You can buy these over the counter in pharmacies, at retail stores, or online.Â At-home tests are also available for free at some local health departments or federally qualified health centers.A swab test can only tell whether you have the virus in your body at that moment. But you may also consider taking an antibody testÂ which can show whether you've ever been exposed to the virus, even if you didn't have symptoms. This is important in officials' efforts to learn how widespread COVID-19 is. In time, it might also help them figure out who's immune to the virus.The FDA is working with laboratories across the country to develop more tests.Coronavirus PreventionGetting vaccinated against COVID-19 is a key part of prevention. But you should also take these steps:Cover your nose and mouth in public. If you have COVID-19, you can spread it even if you don't feel sick. Wear a mask to protect others. This isn't a replacement for social distancing. You still need to keep a 6-foot distance between yourself and those around you. Don't put a face covering on anyone who is:Under 2 years oldHaving trouble breathingUnconscious or can't remove the mask on their own for other reasonsWash your hands often with soap and water or clean them with an alcohol-based sanitizer. This kills viruses on your hands.Don't touch your face. Coronaviruses can live on surfaces you touch for several hours. If they get on your hands and you touch your eyes, nose, or mouth, they can get into your body.Practice social distancing. Because you can have and spread the virus without knowing it, you should stay home as much as possible. If you do have to go out, stay at least 6 feet away from others.Clean and disinfect. You can clean first with soap and water, but disinfect surfaces you touch often, like tables, doorknobs, light switches, toilets, faucets, and sinks. Use a mix of household bleach and water (1/3 cup bleach per gallon of water, or 4 teaspoons bleach per quart of water) or a household cleaner that's approved to treat SARS-CoV-2. You can check the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) website to see if yours made the list. Wear gloves when you clean and throw them away when you're done. There's no proof that herbal therapies and teas can prevent infection.COVID-19 preparation tipsIn addition to practicing the prevention tips listed above, you can:Meet as a household or larger family to talk about who needs what.If you have people at a higher risk, ask their doctor what to do.Talk to your neighbors about emergency planning. Join your neighborhood chat group or website to stay in touch.Find community aid organizations that can help with health care, food delivery, and other supplies.Make an emergency contact list. Include family, friends, neighbors, carpool drivers, doctors, teachers, employers, and the local health department.Choose a room (or rooms) where you can keep someone who's sick or who's been exposed separate from the rest of you.Talk to your child's school about keeping up with assignments.Set yourself up to work from home if your office is closed.Reach out to friends or family if you live alone. Make plans for them to check on you by phone, email, or video chat. Can aÂ face maskÂ protect you from infection?A mask is an added layer of protection for everyone, on top of vaccines and social distancing efforts. You can spread the virus when you talk or cough, even if you don't know that you have it or if you aren't showing signs of infection.It's important to wear a high-quality mask in a variety of situations:Wear a mask indoors in public places if you're in an area where there's a high or âsubstantialâ amount of COVID spreading around. That goes for people 2 years old and up.Â If you have a chronic health condition or you're taking meds that weaken your immune system, wear a mask in indoor public places even if you're fully vaccinated. Do this unless your doctor tells you otherwise. In general, you don't need to wear a mask outside, where it's harder for the coronavirus to spread. But if COVID-19 cases are high in your area, consider wearing one in crowded outdoor places and for outdoor get-togethers that involve close contact with people who aren't fully vaccinated. Anyone should wear a face mask if they're sick and around other people or animals, even at home. Caregivers should use them when cleaning and disinfecting a sick person's bedroom or bathroom. If you need to call 911, put on a mask before medical help arrives.Some people shouldn't wear masks:Kids under 2 years oldSomeone with a disability who can't wear a mask or can't safely wear one to the disabilityA person who has a job in which wearing a mask would create a risk to co-workers' health or safety as determined by the workplace risk assessmentWhat are the different types of face masks?You have several options:Cloth masks are washable and reusable. The best ones have multiple layers of breathable fabric and fit snugly over your nose and mouth. It's a good idea to buy ones that come with a nose wire and are made with fabric that can block light.Disposable masks, also called surgical masks, are also widely available. Choose ones that have several layers of non-woven material. Pick a size that fits properly over your nose and mouth and comes with a nose wire. Don't wear one that has gaps around the sides of your face or nose, or has wet or dirty material. N95 respirator masksÂ fit tightly around your face and filter out 95% or more of the smallest particles in the air.Â It's fine to buy a basic, disposable N95 respirator. Choose one that's high quality and says âNIOSH Approvedâ on the label.Is it safe to travel during a pandemic?Crowded places can raise your chances of getting COVID-19. Itâs important to check the status of COVID-19 transmissions in the area where you travel before you go and take the necessary precautions while there.A few questions may help you decide whether it's safe to travel:Is the coronavirus spreading where you're going?Will you have close contact with other people during the trip?Are you at higher risk of severe illness if you catch the virus?Do you live with someone who has a serious medical condition?Will the place where you'll be staying be cleaned?Will you have access to food and other necessities?If you choose to travel, stay away from sick people. Wash your hands often, and try not to touch your face. Wear a high-quality cloth face mask when you are around other people.Â  How can you help stop the spread of the coronavirus?Because the virus spreads from person to person, it's important to limit your contact with other people as much as possible.Â and avoid large gatherings. Most states and cities have lifted restrictions but this doesn't mean the virus is gone. Continue to follow safety practices such as wearing a high-quality cloth face mask in public places and washing your hands.The following terms have now become commonplace:Social distancing or physical distancing, keeping space between yourself and other people when you have to go outQuarantine, keeping someone home and separated from other people if they might have been exposed to the virusIsolation, keeping sick people away from healthy people, including using a separate âsickâ bedroom and bathroom when possiblePrecautions should still be followed even if you are vaccinated.Coronavirus VaccineThe CDC recommends that everyone 6 months and older be vaccinated. There are fourÂ vaccines,Â which have been granted FDA approval; Pfizer BioNTech, Moderna, Novavax, and Johnson & Johnson.Â  Pfizer and Moderna have developed bivalent boosters, which are so named because they protect against both the original virus that causes COVID-19 and the Omicron variant BA.4 and BA.5Top health experts have a preference for the type of vaccine that you choose. They recommend that you choose a vaccine made with mRNA (like the ones from Pfizer and Moderna) or DNA like Noravax rather than the J&J vaccine, which is made differently. The recommendation is endorsed by the CDC and comes from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which reviewed the latest evidence on the effectiveness, safety, and rare side effects of the available vaccines.That said, receiving any COVID-19 vaccine is better than being unvaccinated, experts say.Booster shots of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are recommended for everyone 5 years and older at least 2 months after you've gotten your first two doses.Â When it comes to boosters, you don't have to stick with same the vaccine you initially got. For example, if your initial doses came from Moderna, you can get a booster dose from Pfizer.COVID-19 vaccines were developed at an unprecedented speed,Â with testing in humans starting in March 2020. The FDA says that no corners were cut to allow for approval and that the inoculationsÂ are safe. The CDC has said it is safe forÂ pregnantÂ women and there's no evidence that antibodies formed from COVID-19 vaccination cause any problems with pregnancy.Coronavirus TreatmentThere's no specific treatment for COVID-19. People who get a mild case need care to ease their symptoms, like rest, fluids, and fever control. Take over-the-counter medicine for a sore throat, body aches, and fever. But don't give aspirin to children or teens younger than 19.You might have heard that you shouldn't take ibuprofen to treat COVID-19 symptoms. But the National Institutes of Health says people who have the virus can use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or acetaminophen as usual.Antibiotics won't help because they treat bacteria, not viruses. In January 2022, the FDA limited the use of two monoclonal treatments that previously were used to treat COVID-19 infections after it was found that they were not effective against the Omicron variant. These two monoclonal antibody treatments are bamlanivimab and etesevimab (administered together) and REGEN-COV (casirivimab and imdevimab).Sotrovimab is the only available monoclonal treatment with activity against the Omicron variant.Â Many clinical trials are underway to explore treatments used for other conditions that could fight COVID-19 and to develop new ones. A variety of steroid medications are being used including dexamethasone which is used to treat conditions such as arthritis, blood/hormone/immune system disorders, and allergic reactions. More studies on effectiveness are still being conducted.Is there a cure for the coronavirus?There's no cure yet, but researchers are working hard to find one.COVID-19 OutlookEvery case is different. You may have mild flu-like symptoms for a few days after exposure, then get better. But some cases can be severe or fatal.Symptoms can also linger for weeks, even if they're mild.More than a third of people older than 18 who have signs of the virus aren't totally recovered 2 or 3 weeks later, according to a CDC survey. Fatigue and cough were the symptoms that were most likely to linger.Some other people who've had COVID-19 develop a condition similar to myalgic encephalomyelitis, also known as chronic fatigue syndrome. They may have brain fog, severe fatigue, pain, trouble thinking, or dizziness.What is the recovery rate for coronavirus? Scientists and researchers are constantly tracking COVID-19 infections and recoveries. But they don't have information about the outcome of every infection. Early estimates predict that the overall COVID-19 recovery rate will be between 97% and 99.75%.Can you get the coronavirus multiple times?Yes. This is another reason to stay vigilant against becoming infected and transmitting the virus.Â As with other coronaviruses that only causeÂ colds, you have a period that you're immune, but that goes away over time.Â That also appears to be the case with this coronavirus. Immunity is estimated to last up to three months.Having COVID-19 usually results in antibodies which should help protect you from re-infection. But the virus continues to mutate and these changes can lead to new variants which allow the risk for re-infection.The CDC is investigating how often reinfections occur, who is at higher risk of reinfection, how soon reinfections take place after a previous infection, and the severity of reinfections compared with initial infections.Â Past CoronavirusesAre coronaviruses new?Coronaviruses were first identified in the 1960s. Almost everyone gets a coronavirus infection at least once in their life, most likely as a young child. In the United States, regular coronaviruses are more common in the fall and winter, but anyone can come down with a coronavirus infection at any time.The symptoms of most coronaviruses are similar to any other upper respiratory infection, including a runny nose, coughing, sore throat, and sometimes a fever. In most cases, you won't know whether you have a coronavirus or a different cold-causing virus, such as a rhinovirus. You treat this kind of coronavirus infection the same way you treat a cold.Have there been other serious coronavirus outbreaks?Coronaviruses have led to two serious outbreaks:Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). About 858 people have died from MERS, which first appeared in Saudi Arabia and then in other countries in the Middle East, Africa, Asia, and Europe. In April 2014, the first American was hospitalized for MERS in Indiana, and another case was reported in Florida. Both had just returned from Saudi Arabia. In May 2015, there was an outbreak of MERS in South Korea, which was the largest outbreak outside of the Arabian Peninsula.Severe acute respiratory syndromeÂ (SARS).Â In 2003, 774 people died from an outbreak. As of 2015, there were no further reports of cases of SARS."

You might have:Fever above 100 FSevere aches in your muscles and jointsWeakness or severe fatigueWarm, flushed skin and red, watery eyesChillsA headacheA dry coughA sore throat and runny noseVomiting and diarrhea with flu is more common in children.Â Get medical help right away if you have:Trouble breathing or shortness of breathPain or pressure in your chest or bellySudden dizzinessConfusionSevere vomitingThese symptoms can mean your illness is severe.Flu Symptoms vs. Cold SymptomsThe symptoms of colds and flu can be a lot alike. Hereâs how to tell which one is making you sick:Fever. It can last 3 or 4 days with the flu; itâs rare with a cold.Aches. They might be severe with the flu; theyâre mild with a cold.Chills. Youâre likely to have them with the flu, but theyâre rare with a cold.Fatigue. This is common with the flu and happens sometimes with a cold.Sneezing. Youâre more likely to have this with a cold than with the flu.Cough and chest discomfort. This is common with both but tends to be severe with the flu.Stuffy nose. This sometimes happens with the flu but is common with a cold.Sore throat. This can be common with the flu but is more likely with a cold.Headache. This is common when you have the flu but rare with a cold.How to Treat Flu SymptomsIn most cases, the best things to do when you have the flu are:Rest at home.Drink plenty of fluids.Avoid contact with other people.Your doctor might give you prescription medications called antiviral drugs if youâre at higher risk of complications, such as if you:Are very sick or have other medical conditionsAre younger than 2 or older than 65Have a weak immune systemAre pregnantAre a Native American or an Alaska NativeThese medicines -- baloxavir marboxil (Xofluza), oseltamivir (Tamiflu), peramivir (Rapivab), and zanamivir (Relenza) -- work best when you take them 48 hours or less after your symptoms start. Antivirals can decrease the severity and duration of illness and may prevent serious complications related to the flu.Flu ComplicationsPeople who are otherwise healthy donât usually have serious problems from the flu.Flu complications include:PneumoniaSinus infection (sinusitis)Ear infectionInflamed bronchial tubes in your lungs (bronchitis)Asthma flare-upsHeart inflammation (myocarditis)Brain inflammation (encephalitis)Muscle problemsChronic heart disease flare-upsOrgan failureÂ When Is Flu Season?Seasonal flu follows a pattern, starting in the fall and ending in the spring. The first sign is often a sudden rise in the number of school-age children sick at home. This is soon followed by more illness in other groups, including parents."
3,webmd,https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/common_cold_overview,Common Cold,"OverviewSneezing, scratchy throat, runny nose -- everyone knows the first signs of a cold, probably the most common illness known. These symptoms are usually caused by a viral infection. Although the common cold is usually mild, with symptoms lasting 1 to 2 weeks, it is a leading cause of doctor visits and missed days from school and work. According to the CDC, 22 million school days are lost annually in the United States because of the common cold.In the course of a year, people in the U.S. suffer 1 billion colds, according to some estimates.Children have about 6 to 10 colds a year. One important reason why colds are so common in children is because they are often in close contact with each other in daycare centers and schools. In families with children in school, the number of colds per child can be as high as 12 a year. Adults average about 2 to 4 colds a year, although the range varies widely. Women, especially those aged 20 to 30 years, have more colds than men, possibly because of their closer contact with children. On average, people older than age 60 have fewer than one cold a year. In the U.S., most colds occur during the fall and winter. Beginning in late August or early September, the rate of colds increases slowly for a few weeks and remains high until March or April, when it declines. The seasonal variation may relate to the opening of schools and to cold weather, which prompt people to spend more time indoors and increase the chances that viruses will spread to you from someone else.Seasonal changes in relative humidity also may affect the prevalence of colds. The most common cold-causing viruses survive better when humidity is low-the colder months of the year. Cold weather also may make the inside lining of your nose drier and more vulnerable to viral infection."
4,webmd,https://www.webmd.com/allergies/allergy-basics,Common Cold,"What Is an Allergy?It's what happens when your immune system reacts to something thatâs usually harmless. Those triggers, which doctors call ""allergens,"" can include pollen, mold, and animal dander, certain foods, or things that irritate your skin.Allergies are very common. At least 1 in 5 Americans has one.What Happens During an Allergic Reaction?It starts when you come into contact with a trigger that you inhale, swallow, or get on your skin.In response, your body starts to make a protein called IgE, which grabs onto the allergen. Then histamine and other chemicals get released into the blood. That causes the symptoms you notice.What Are the Symptoms?Your symptoms depend on how youâre exposed -- through the air, your skin, food, or through an insect sting.If youâve got a nasal allergy (one that's triggered by something you inhale), common symptoms include:Itchy, watery eyesSneezingItchy, runny noseFeeling tired or illCommon symptoms of a skin allergy include rashes and hives (a rash with raised red patches). Your skin may be red, itchy, or swollen. Food allergies can also cause stomach cramps, vomiting, and diarrhea.If an insect sting was the trigger, youâll have swelling, redness, and pain where it stung you.Symptoms can range from mild to severe. Most go away shortly after the exposure stops.Mild ones may be almost unnoticeable. You might just feel a little âoff.âModerate symptoms can make you feel ill, as if youâve got a cold or even the flu.Severe allergic reactions are extreme.Is It Anaphylaxis?The most severe allergic reaction is called anaphylaxis. It affects your whole body. Symptoms can include:Hives and itching all overWheezing or shortness of breathHoarseness or tightness in the throatSwelling of the face, eyelids, lips, tongue, or throatTingling in the hands, feet, lips, or scalpAnaphylaxis is life-threatening, so call 911 right away. If you have an epinephrine auto-injector, use it and repeat after 5 to 15 minutes if your symptoms havenât improved. Youâll still need medical care right after you give yourself the shots, even if your symptoms seem to stop, because a delayed reaction could still happen."
5,webmd,https://www.webmd.com/lung/rsv-in-babies,Respiratory Syncytial Virus,"What Is Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV)?Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common, and very contagious, virus that infects the respiratory tract of most children before their second birthday.For most babies and young children, the infection causes nothing more than a cold. But for a small percentage, infection with RSV can lead to serious, sometimes life-threatening problems such as pneumonia or bronchiolitis, an inflammation of the small airways of the lungs.RSV SymptomsRSV infection can cause cold-like symptoms, including a cough and runny nose, which usually last 1 to 2 weeks.When to see a doctor: Call your baby's doctor if you notice any of the following RSV symptoms:A high-pitched whistling or wheezing noise when they breatheBeing unusually upset or inactiveA cough with yellow, green, or gray mucusTrouble breathing or pauses in their breathsRefusing to breastfeed or bottle-feedSigns of dehydration: lack of tears when crying, little or no urine in their diaper for 6 hours, and cool, dry skinIf your baby is very tired, breathes rapidly, has difficulty in breathing, or has a blue tint to their lips or fingernails, call 911 or go to the ER immediately.RSV Causes and Risk FactorsRespiratory syncytial virus spreads through the air, like after a cough or a sneeze, and through direct contact like touching.The chance of a severe infection is highest for:Babies born prematurelyChildren younger than 2 who were born with heart or lung diseaseInfants and young children whose immune systems are weakened because of illness or medical treatmentChildren under 8 to 10 weeks oldRSV DiagnosisTo diagnose RSV, your childâs doctor will probably look at their medical history and do a physical exam, including listening to their lungs.Your doctor might do some tests if your child is very sick or in order to rule out other problems. Tests for RSV include:Blood and urine tests to look for a bacterial infection and make sure your child isnât dehydratedChest X-rays to look for any signs of pneumoniaTests of material scraped out of your childâs nose or mouthRSV PreventionSteps you can take to try to avoid and prevent RSV include:Avoid kissing your baby if you have cold symptoms.Clean and disinfect hard surfaces.Donât let anyone smoke around your baby.If possible, keep your baby away from anyone, including siblings, with cold symptoms.Keep your baby away from crowds.Ask people to wash their hands before they touch your baby.Limit the time high-risk babies and young children stay in daycare, particularly from late fall to early spring, when RSV is most common.Wash your hands often, especially after contact with anyone who has cold symptoms. AÂ medication calledÂ palivizumab may prevent RSV infections and protect high-risk babies from serious complications of RSV infection. If your baby is at high risk, your doctor may give them a monthly shot of it during peak RSV season.Â While palivizumab is a short acting monoclonal antibody, there is a long acting monoclonal antibody called nirsevimab that may be approved this year for infants. Also, a vaccine for pregnant people is expected to be presented to the FDA for approval in 2023. Older adults can also be susceptible to RSV and two vaccines should be available later in 2023 for those 60 and older to help them avoid serious illness and hospitalization.Â RSV TreatmentsAlthough palivizumab may help prevent serious complications of RSV infection, doctors donât use it to treat RSV. No medication treats the virus itself. So caring for a baby with RSV infection involves treating the symptoms and how it affects your babyâs respiratory system.Most babies and young children can be cared for at home:Remove sticky nasal fluids with a bulb syringe and saline drops.Use a cool-mist vaporizer to keep the air moist and make breathing easier.Give your little one fluids in small amounts throughout the day.Use non-aspirin fever-reducers such as acetaminophen. Check the label and follow all directions carefully.Babies with more serious cases may need to go to a hospital, where their treatment may include:OxygenIV fluidsMedications or procedures (intubation) to open their airways"
6,webmd,https://www.webmd.com/lung/understanding-pneumonia-basics,Pneumonia,"What Is Pneumonia?PneumoniaÂ is a lung infection that can range from mild to so severe that you have to go to the hospital.It happens when an infection causes the air sacs in yourÂ lungsÂ (your doctor will call them alveoli) to fill with fluid or pus. That can make it hard for you to breathe in enough oxygen to reach your bloodstream.Anyone can get this lung infection. But infants younger than age 2 and people over age 65 are at higher risk. Thatâs because their immune systems might not be strong enough to fight it.You can get pneumonia in one or both lungs. You can also have it and not know it. Doctors call thisÂ walking pneumonia. Causes include bacteria, viruses, and fungi.Â  If your pneumonia results from bacteria or a virus, you can spread it to someone else.Â Lifestyle habits, likeÂ smokingÂ cigarettes and drinking too much alcohol, can also raise your chances of getting pneumonia.Symptoms of PneumoniaYour symptoms can vary depending on whatâs causing your pneumonia, your age, and your overall health. They usually develop over several days.Common pneumonia symptoms include:Chest pain when you breathe or coughCough that produces phlegm or mucusFatigue and loss of appetiteFever, sweating, and chillsNausea, vomiting, and diarrheaShortness of breathAlong with these symptoms, older adults and people with weak immune systems might be confused or have changes in mental awareness, or they might have a lower-than-usual body temperature.Newborns and infants may not show any signs of infection. Or they might vomit, have a fever and a cough, and seem restless or tired.If you have a new cough, fever, or shortness of breath, call your doctor to ask about whether it could be COVID-19. Illness with the new coronavirus can also lead to pneumonia.Causes of PneumoniaBacteria, viruses, or fungi can cause pneumonia.Common causes include:Flu virusesCold virusesRSV virus (the top cause of pneumonia in babies age 1 or younger)Bacteria calledÂ Streptococcus pneumoniaeÂ andÂ Mycoplasma pneumoniae Some people who are in the hospital get âventilator-associated pneumoniaâ if they got the infection while using a ventilator, a machine that helps you breathe.If you get pneumonia while youâre in a hospital and arenât on a ventilator, thatâs called âhospital-acquiredâ pneumonia. But most people get âcommunity-acquired pneumonia,â which means they didnât get it in a hospital.Pneumonia DiagnosisYour doctor will start with questions about your symptoms and your medical history, like whether you smoke and whether youâve been around sick people at home, school, or work. Then, theyâll listen to your lungs. If you have pneumonia, they might hear cracking, bubbling, or rumbling sounds when you breathe in.If your doctor thinks you might have pneumonia, theyâll probably give you tests, including:Blood tests to look for signs of a bacterial infectionA chest X-ray to find the infection in your lungs and how far itâs spreadPulse oximetry to measure the level of oxygen in your bloodA sputum test to check the fluid in your lungs for the cause of an infectionIf your symptoms started in the hospital or you have other health problems, your doctor might give you more tests, such as:An arterial blood gas test to measure the oxygen in a small amount of blood taken from one of your arteriesBronchoscopy to check your airways for blockages or other problemsA CT scan to get a more detailed image of your lungsA pleural fluid culture, in which the doctor removes a small amount of fluid from the tissues around your lungs to look for bacteria that might cause pneumoniaPneumonia ComplicationsPneumonia can have complications, including:Bacteremia,Â in which bacteria spread into your blood. This can cause septic shock and organ failure.Trouble breathing,Â which might mean you need to use a breathing machine while your lungs heal.Fluid buildupÂ between the layers of tissue that line your lungs and chest cavity. This fluid can also become infected.Lung abscess,Â when a pocket of pus forms inside or around your lung.Pneumonia TreatmentYour doctor can tell you which treatment is right for you.If you have bacterial pneumonia, youâll get antibiotics. Make sure you take all of the medicine your doctor gives you, even if you start to feel better before youâre through with it.If you have viral pneumonia, antibiotics wonât help. Youâll need to rest, drink a lot of fluids, and take medicine for your fever.If your symptoms are severe or if you have other conditions that make you more likely to have complications, your doctor may send you to the hospital. While youâre there, your doctor will probably give you fluids or antibiotics through an IV tube. You may even need oxygen therapy or breathing treatments.With any kind of pneumonia, recovery will take time. Youâre going to need lots of rest. You might need a week off your usual routines, and you could still feel tired for a month."
7,webmd,https://www.webmd.com/lung/walking-pneumonia,Pneumonia,"âWalking pneumonia"" sounds like it could be the name of a sci-fi horror flick. But it's actually the least scary kind of pneumonia. It can be milder than the other types, and you usually donât have to stay in the hospital. You could have walking pneumonia and not even know it.It Might Feel Like a ColdWalking pneumonia is how some people describe a mild case of pneumonia. Your doctor might call it âatypical pneumoniaâ because itâs not like more serious cases.AÂ lungÂ infection is often to blame. Lots of things can cause it, including:BacteriaVirusesFungiChemicalsInhaled foodWalking pneumonia usually is due to bacteria calledÂ MycoplasmaÂ pneumoniae.You probably wonât have to stay in bed or in the hospital. You might even feel good enough go to work and keep up your routine, just as you might with aÂ cold.Who Gets It?Anyone can get it. Walking pneumonia from mycoplasma is most common in children, military recruits, and adults younger than 40. People who live and work in crowded places -- such asÂ schools, dorms, military barracks, and nursing homesÂ -- are more likely to come into contact with it.Late summer and fall are the most common times of year for walking pneumonia. But infections can happen throughout the year.Is It Contagious?Walking pneumonia spreads through sneezes orÂ coughs. But it spreads slowly. If you get it, you could be contagious (which means you could spread it to other people) for up to 10 days.Researchers think it takes a lot of close contact with an infected person for a healthy person to catch walking pneumonia. Still, there are widespread outbreaks every 4 to 8 years.SymptomsSymptoms generally start 15 to 25 days after youâre exposed to mycoplasma and slowly get worse over 2 to 4 days. You might have:Chest painÂ when you take a deep breathA coughÂ that may come in violent spasmsMildÂ flu-like symptoms such asÂ fever and chillsSore throatHeadacheTirednessWeaknessÂ that may last after other symptoms go away Some people with walking pneumonia may also have anÂ ear infection,Â anemia, or aÂ skin rash.If you have a new cough, fever, or shortness of breath, call your doctor to talk about whether it might be COVID-19, the illness caused by the new coronavirus.DiagnosisSymptoms generally start 15 to 25 days after youâre exposed to mycoplasma and slowly get worse over 2 to 4 days. You might have:Chest painÂ when you take a deep breathA coughÂ that may come in violent spasmsMildÂ flu-like symptoms such asÂ fever and chillsSore throatHeadacheTirednessWeaknessÂ that may last after other symptoms go awaySome people with walking pneumonia may also have anÂ ear infection,Â anemia, or aÂ skin rash.If you have a new cough, fever, or shortness of breath, call your doctor to talk about whether it might be COVID-19, the illness caused by the new coronavirus.TreatmentMany over-the-counter medicines forÂ coldÂ and flu may not relieve all of your symptoms.Your doctor might prescribeÂ antibiotics. They should make you feel better within a few days.Tell your doctor about any other medicines you take or plan to take. Drink plenty of fluids and give yourself lots of time to rest.Can I Get Walking Pneumonia More Than Once?Itâs possible. You might have someÂ immunityÂ for a while, but it's not clear how long it lasts. If you do get it again, it may be milder than the first time.PreventionThereâs noÂ vaccineÂ for mycoplasma infection, so you canât completely prevent it. But you can take some steps to lower your chances of getting it:Exercise, eat a well-balanced diet, and get enoughÂ sleep to keep your body healthy and better able to resist infection.Wash your handsÂ often. Itâs one of the best ways to prevent germs from spreading.Don't smoke.Â SmokingÂ damages yourÂ lungs, and damagedÂ lungsÂ are more likely to get infected.Cover yourÂ mouthÂ with a tissue or your sleeve when youÂ coughÂ orÂ sneeze. Ask others to do the same.Â CoughingÂ andÂ sneezingÂ are the main ways that these infections are spread."
8,webmd,https://www.webmd.com/lung/lung-what-is-sars,Severe acute respiratory syndrome,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, is a potentially deadly illness that quickly spread around the world in 2003. Itâs a viral infection that causes flu-like symptoms.Sudden OutbreakSARS first sprang to the worldâs attention in early 2003, when more than 8,000 people got sick in an outbreak that spread to 26 countries. Nearly 800 people died.Doctors and scientists tracked the disease to southeastern China, near Hong Kong. From there, travelers soon carried SARS to other countries in Asia, such as Vietnam and Singapore, as well as Europe and Canada. Public health officials around the world scrambled to contain the outbreak. Weâve had no reported cases since 2004.CausesSARS is caused by a virus that takes over your bodyâs cells and uses them to make copies of itself. The SARS virus is from a group known as coronaviruses, which also cause the common cold.SARS can spread when people who have it cough or sneeze, spraying tiny droplets of liquid with the virus to other people within 2-3 feet. Other people may get the virus by touching something those droplets hit, then touching their nose, eyes, or mouth.People who live with or are in close contact with someone who has SARS are more likely to get it than someone who is just passing by or sharing a room with an infected person.SymptomsThe symptoms of SARS start off similar to the flu. They may include:A fever over 100.4 F (38 C)ChillsMuscle achesAbout 1 in 5 people with SARS may also get diarrhea.But the symptoms can get worse fast. SARS causes a dry cough that shows up anywhere from 2 to 7 days into the illness. This cough can keep your body from getting enough oxygen, and more than 1 in 10 people with SARS will need a machine to help them breathe.SARS can lead to other health problems, including pneumonia, heart failure, and liver failure. People who are over 60 and have ongoing illnesses like diabetes or hepatitis are most likely to have these problems.DiagnosisIf you have symptoms like a high fever, chest pain, or difficulty breathing, you should see a doctor, especially if youâve just come back from a trip overseas.If there has been a new outbreak of SARS, you should tell your doctor whether you have been to the area where the outbreak happened. And if you think you have been exposed to SARS, you should avoid public places and take other steps so you donât pass it on to others. Doctors might also ask whether you work in a lab or a medical center where you might have been exposed to the virus or whether you have some connection to other people with serious respiratory infections like pneumonia.If your doctor suspects you have SARS, they can confirm it with lab tests and images from an X-ray or CT scan.TreatmentIt will depend on how severe your case is. If your symptoms are mild, you may be allowed to recover at home. But if they get worse, you may have to go to a hospital for more treatment, like getting fluids or oxygen.No drugs work against the virus that causes SARS. But you may get antibiotics to fight off other infections while you recover.PreventionThereâs no cure for SARS. You can lower your chances of getting it in the first place with some simple steps:Wash your hands often with soap and water, or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.Donât touch your eyes, nose, or mouth with dirty hands.Wear disposable gloves if you have contact with someoneâs pee, poop, saliva, or other body fluids.Wipe surfaces like countertops with disinfectants, and wash personal items with soap and hot water.If youâre around someone with SARS, wear a surgical mask to cover your nose and mouth."

Who can have COVID-19 treatment You're eligible for COVID-19 treatment without being admitted to hospital if all the following apply: you're aged 12 or over you're at highest risk of getting seriously ill from COVID-19 you have symptoms of COVID-19 you have tested positive for COVID-19 Some treatments are also available through a national study to a wider group of people, including those aged 50 years old and over (or 18 years old and over with a health condition that puts them at increased risk of COVID-19). Visit the Panoramic trial website if you're interested in taking part.
Treatments for COVID-19 The treatments available for people at the highest risk of becoming seriously ill from COVID-19 are: nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir (Paxlovid) sotrovimab (Xevudy) remdesivir (Veklury) molnupiravir (Lagevrio) Nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir, remdesivir and molnupiravir are antiviral medicines. Sotrovimab is known as a neutralising monoclonal antibody (nMAb). Sotrovimab is recommended if nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir (Paxlovid) is not suitable. Some treatments come as capsules or tablets that you swallow. Others are given to you through a drip in your arm (infusion), usually in a hospital or local health centre. These treatments can help some people manage their COVID-19 symptoms and reduce the risk of becoming seriously ill. You'll be told which treatment, if any, is most suitable for you.
Information: If you need to go into hospital for COVID-19, you may get other treatments. How to get COVID-19 treatment Local NHS organisations are responsible for arranging COVID-19 treatments. The way you get treatment may depend on where you live. Your local integrated care board (ICB) can give you more information. If you think you're in the highest risk group and need to access COVID-19 treatment, but do not have information from your local NHS organisation, follow these steps to be considered for a referral. 1. Take a rapid lateral flow test if you get symptoms If you have any symptoms of COVID-19, take a rapid lateral flow test as soon as possible, even if your symptoms are mild. Only take a test if you have symptoms. If you're eligible for COVID-19 treatment, you should keep rapid lateral flow tests at home. You can order free NHS rapid lateral flow test kits on GOV.UK or by calling NHS 119. You can also use tests you've paid for, for example, a test you've bought from a supermarket or pharmacy. Order NHS rapid lateral flow test kits on GOV.UK 2. If your test is positive, call your GP surgery, NHS 111 or hospital specialist Call your GP surgery, NHS 111 or hospital specialist as soon as possible if your test result is positive. They'll decide if you need referring for an assessment for COVID-19 treatment. They may ask what other medicines you take or receive, including any vitamins and minerals, so it's important to have a list of these ready. If you're eligible for treatment, it's important to start the treatment as soon as you can. Treatments for COVID-19 need to be given quickly after your symptoms start to be effective. The medicine can be collected on your behalf by someone else, such as a friend or relative. Alternatively, the NHS may be able to arrange for the medicine to be delivered to you. If the treatment needs to be given as a drip in your arm (infusion), you'll usually get it at your local hospital or in a local health centre. You'll get instructions on where to get the treatment and how to get there and back safely. 3. If your test is negative, do a total of 3 tests over 3 days If your test result is negative, but you still have symptoms of COVID-19, you need to do a total of 3 rapid lateral flow tests over 3 days. For example, if you did your first test today, you should do a 2nd test tomorrow and a 3rd test the day after."

It gives you the best protection against COVID-19. Who can get a COVID-19 vaccine Only children aged 6 months to 4 years old who are at increased risk of getting seriously ill from COVID-19 can currently get a COVID-19 vaccine. You may be able to get a seasonal COVID-19 vaccine in autumn 2023 if you're at increased risk of getting seriously ill from COVID-19. For example, this may be due to a health condition or your age. The NHS will contact you if your NHS record suggests you may be eligible. If you develop a new health condition or start treatment that severely weakens your immune system, your specialist may advise you to get a COVID-19 vaccine sooner. Speak to your specialist for more information. Find out more about getting a COVID-19 vaccine 
Which COVID-19 vaccine will I get? There are several different COVID-19 vaccines in use in the UK. They have all met strict standards of safety, quality and effectiveness. Most people can have any of the COVID-19 vaccines and will be offered a vaccine that gives protection from more than one type of COVID-19. You cannot choose which vaccine you have. Some people are only offered certain vaccines, for example: if you're pregnant if you're under 18 years old if you're 75 years old or over in very rare cases if you’ve had a severe allergic reaction to one of the common vaccines you may be referred to a specialist clinic for an alternative COVID-19 vaccine Children under 12 years old will be given smaller doses than older children and adults. 
How well do the COVID-19 vaccines work? If you' are re at increased risk of severe COVID-19, getting a seasonal COVID-19 vaccine is the best way to protect yourself and others. Research has shown the vaccine helps: reduce your risk of getting seriously ill or dying from COVID-19 reduce your risk of catching and spreading COVID-19 protect against different strains (variants) of COVID-19 Seasonal vaccines are offered because protection fades over time. A vaccine helps give you good protection from becoming seriously ill or needing to go to hospital if you catch COVID-19.

How long does it take to recover? How long it takes to recover from COVID-19 is different for everybody. Recovering from long COVID: Recovery from long COVID varies. Some symptoms can improve quickly and others last longer. The chances of having long-term symptoms does not seem to be linked to how ill you are when you first get COVID-19. People who had mild symptoms at first can still have long-term problems."
15,National Health Service,https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/flu/,Influenza,"Flu will often get better on its own, but it can make some people seriously ill. It's important to get the flu vaccine if you're advised to. Check if you have flu Flu symptoms come on very quickly and can include: a sudden high temperature an aching body feeling tired or exhausted a dry cough a sore throat a headache difficulty sleeping loss of appetite diarrhoea or tummy pain feeling sick and being sick The symptoms are similar for children, but they can also get pain in their ear and appear less active. 
How to treat flu yourself If you have flu, there are some things you can do to help get better more quickly. 
Do rest and sleep keep warm take paracetamol or ibuprofen to lower your temperature and treat aches and pains drink plenty of water to avoid dehydration (your pee should be light yellow or clear) A pharmacist can help with flu A pharmacist can give treatment advice and recommend flu remedies. Do not take paracetamol and flu remedies that contain paracetamol at the same time as it's easy to take more than the recommended dose. Find a pharmacy
Information: Antibiotics GPs do not recommend antibiotics for flu because they will not relieve your symptoms or speed up your recovery. Urgent advice:Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if: You or your child have symptoms of flu and: you're worried about your baby's or child's symptoms you're 65 or over you're pregnant you have a long-term medical condition – for example, diabetes or a condition that affects your heart, lungs, kidneys, brain or nerves you have a weakened immune system – for example, because of chemotherapy or HIV your symptoms do not improve after 7 days You can call 111 or get help from 111 online.
How to avoid spreading the flu Flu is very infectious and easily spread to other people. You're more likely to give it to others in the first 5 days. Flu is spread by germs from coughs and sneezes, which can live on hands and surfaces for 24 hours. To reduce the risk of spreading flu: wash your hands often with warm water and soap cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze bin used tissues as quickly as possible Try to stay at home and avoid contact with other people if you have a high temperature or you do not feel well enough to do your normal activities. See how to wash your hands correctly How to get a flu vaccine Flu vaccines are safe and effective. They're offered every year on the NHS to help protect people at risk of flu and its complications. The best time to have a flu vaccine is in the autumn before flu starts spreading. But you can get vaccinated later."
16,National Health Service,https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/common-cold/,Common Cold,"You can often treat a cold without seeing a GP. You should begin to feel better in about 1 to 2 weeks. Check if you have a cold Cold symptoms come on gradually and can include: a blocked or runny nose a sore throat headaches muscle aches coughs sneezing a raised temperature pressure in your ears and face loss of taste and smell The symptoms are the same in adults and children. Sometimes symptoms last longer in children. Telling the difference between cold and flu 
How you can treat a cold yourself To help you get better more quickly: rest and sleep drink plenty of water (fruit juice or squash mixed with water is OK) to avoid dehydration gargle salt water to soothe a sore throat (not suitable for children) If you have a high temperature or you do not feel well enough to do your normal activities, try to stay at home and avoid contact with other people until you feel better. A pharmacist can help with cold medicines You can buy cough and cold medicines from pharmacies or supermarkets. A pharmacist can advise you on the best medicine.
You can: ease aches or lower a temperature with painkillers like paracetamol or ibuprofen relieve a blocked nose with decongestant sprays or tablets Decongestants should not be given to children under 6. Children aged 6 to 12 should take them for no longer than 5 days. Be careful not to use cough and cold medicines if you're taking paracetamol and ibuprofen tablets. Cough and cold medicines often also contain paracetamol and ibuprofen so it can be easy to take more than the recommended dose. Some are not suitable for children, babies and pregnant women. There's little evidence that supplements (such as vitamin C, echinacea or garlic) prevent colds or speed up recovery.

Antibiotics are only effective against bacterial infections, and colds are caused by viruses.
How to avoid spreading a cold Colds are caused by viruses and easily spread to other people. You're infectious until all your symptoms have gone. This usually takes 1 to 2 weeks. Colds are spread by germs from coughs and sneezes, which can live on hands and surfaces for 24 hours. To reduce the risk of spreading a cold: wash your hands often with warm water and soap use tissues to trap germs when you cough or sneeze bin used tissues as quickly as possible 
How to prevent catching a cold A person with a cold can start spreading it from a few days before their symptoms begin until the symptoms have finished. The best ways to avoid catching a cold are: washing your hands with warm water and soap not sharing towels or household items (like cups) with someone who has a cold not touching your eyes or nose in case you have come into contact with the virus – it can infect the body this way staying fit and healthy The flu vaccine helps prevent flu but not colds."
17,National Health Service,https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/respiratory-tract-infection/,Respiratory Tract Infections,"Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are infections of parts of the body involved in breathing, such as the sinuses, throat, airways or lungs. Most RTIs get better without treatment, but sometimes you may need to see a GP. Check if you have an RTI Symptoms of an RTI include: a cough – you may bring up mucus (phlegm) sneezing a stuffy or runny nose a sore throat headaches muscle aches breathlessness, tight chest or wheezing a high temperature feeling generally unwell Things you can do yourself Most RTIs pass within 1 to 2 weeks. You can usually treat your symptoms at home. 
Do get plenty of rest drink lots of water to loosen any mucus and make it easier to cough up drink a hot lemon and honey drink to help soothe a cough (not suitable for babies under 1 year old) gargle with warm salty water if you have a sore throat (children should not try this) raise your head up while sleeping using extra pillows to make breathing easier and clear your chest of mucus use painkillers to bring down a fever and help ease a sore throat, headaches and muscle pain try to stay at home and avoid contact with other people if you have a high temperature or you do not feel well enough to do your normal activities 
Don’t do not let children breathe in steam from a bowl of hot water as there's a risk of scalding do not give aspirin to children under 16 do not smoke – it can make your symptoms worse How to make a hot lemon and honey drink 
A pharmacist can help with an RTI A pharmacist can suggest treatments to help relieve your symptoms, such as decongestants and nasal sprays. You can also buy cough medicines and throat lozenges, although there's little evidence to show they help. Some treatments contain paracetamol and ibuprofen. If you're taking these medicines separately, be careful not to take more than the recommended dose. Certain treatments are not suitable for children, babies and pregnant women. Your pharmacist can advise you about the best treatment for you or your child. Find a pharmacy
Non-urgent advice:See a GP if: you feel very unwell or your symptoms get worse you cough up blood or bloodstained mucus you have had a cough for more than 3 weeks you're pregnant you're over 65 you have a weakened immune system – for example, because you have a condition like diabetes or you're having chemotherapy you have a long-term health condition, such as a heart, lung or kidney condition You may have pneumonia if your symptoms are severe. 
Treatment from a GP Treatment will depend on the cause of your RTI: a virus (like colds) – this usually clears up by itself after a few weeks and antibiotics will not help bacteria (like pneumonia) – a GP may prescribe antibiotics (make sure you complete the whole course as advised by a GP, even if you start to feel better) Sometimes a sample of your mucus may need to be tested to see what's causing your RTI. 
Important:Use of antibiotics Antibiotics are only used to treat bacterial infections. They're not used for treating viral infections because they do not work for this type of infection. 
How to avoid passing RTIs on to others: cover your mouth when you cough or sneeze wash your hands regularly throw away used tissues immediately How to avoid getting an RTI If you keep getting RTIs or you're at a high risk of getting one (for example, because you're over the age of 65 or have a serious long-term health condition), you should: ask a GP about the annual flu vaccination – find out if you're eligible for the free flu vaccine ask if you should have the pneumococcal vaccine – this helps prevent pneumonia stop smoking if you smoke drink less alcohol Causes and types of RTIs RTIs are often spread in the coughs and sneezes of someone with an infection. There are several different types. They're usually grouped into upper and lower RTIs."

Most people get better in 2 to 4 weeks, but babies, older people, and people with heart or lung conditions are at risk of getting seriously ill and may need treatment in hospital. 
Check if you have pneumonia Symptoms of pneumonia can start suddenly or gradually over a few days. They include: a cough – you may cough up yellow or green mucus (phlegm) shortness of breath a high temperature chest pain an aching body feeling very tired loss of appetite making wheezing noises when you breathe – babies may also make grunting noises feeling confused – this is common in older people Urgent advice:Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if: you've had a cough for 3 weeks or more you're coughing up blood you have chest pain that comes and goes, or happens when breathing or coughing you're feeling short of breath You can call 111 or get help from 111 online.
Immediate action required: you're struggling to breathe – you're choking, gasping and unable to speak you have pale, blue or blotchy skin, lips or tongue you suddenly feel confused – for example, you do not know where you are you cannot wake your baby and they feel floppy
Treatment for pneumonia You'll usually be given antibiotics to treat pneumonia. Most people get better in 2 to 4 weeks. Some people are more at risk of becoming seriously ill. You may need to go to hospital for treatment if: you're over 65 you have cardiovascular disease or a long-term lung condition your baby or young child has pneumonia you're very unwell In hospital you'll usually be given fluids and antibiotics to treat the infection. You may also be given oxygen to help you breathe. You may be sent for an X-ray of your chest and blood tests to check for other conditions. Important If you're given antibiotics to take at home, contact your doctor if you do not feel better after taking them for 2 to 3 days. 
Things you can do if you have pneumonia There are some things you can do to help with recovery from pneumonia and reduce the risk of spreading it to other people. Do rest until you feel better – try to stay at home and avoid contact with other people if you have a high temperature or do not feel well enough to do normal activities drink plenty of fluids take paracetamol or ibuprofen to help with pain or a high temperature cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze put used tissues in the bin as quickly as possible wash your hands regularly with water and soap 
Don’t do not take cough medicine – coughing helps your body get rid of the infection do not smoke Causes of pneumonia Pneumonia is usually caused by a bacterial or viral infection. You can catch it from someone who has it, or you can sometimes get it if you have another infection such as flu or coronavirus (COVID-19). It can be caused by a fungal infection but this is rare in healthy people in the UK. It may also be caused by something getting into your lungs, such as water or food (aspiration pneumonia). Pneumonia vaccination If you're at risk of getting seriously ill with pneumonia, it's recommended you get the pneumococcal vaccine, also known as the pneumonia vaccine. It protects against an infection that can cause pneumonia. People at high risk include: babies adults aged over 65 people with heart, lung, liver, kidney or neurological conditions with a risk of aspiration people with diabetes people with a weakened immune system, for example, you have a condition that stops your immune system working properly, or you are having treatment to suppress your immune system Adults and children more at risk should also get a flu vaccine every year. You can ask a GP or pharmacist about both vaccines. Stopping smoking also reduces your chance of getting pneumonia."
19,National Health Service,https://www.nhs.uk/common-health-questions/infections/is-pneumonia-contagious/,Pneumonia,"Pneumonia is swelling (inflammation) of the tissue in one or both lungs. It's usually caused by an infection, most commonly bacteria and viruses, which are both contagious.
Catching pneumonia The germs that can cause pneumonia are usually breathed in. People often have small amounts of germs in their nose and throat that can be passed on through: coughs and sneezes – these launch tiny droplets of fluid containing germs into the air, which someone else can breathe in touching an object and transferring germs on to it – someone else can touch this object and then touch their own mouth or nose Preventing the spread of pneumonia You can help prevent the spread of a pneumonia by taking some simple hygiene precautions. These include: washing your hands regularly and thoroughly, particularly after touching your nose and mouth, and before handling food coughing and sneezing into a tissue, then throwing it away immediately and washing your hands not sharing cups or kitchen utensils with others
Vaccination The pneumococcal vaccine protects against Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is the most common cause of bacterial pneumonia. Vaccination is recommended for: babies adults aged 65 or over children and adults with certain long-term health conditions, such as a serious heart or kidney condition The pneumococcal vaccine is usually given as part of the routine NHS child vaccination schedule. If you're unsure if you or your child has been given the vaccine, check with your GP."
20,National Health Service,https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-mers/,Middle East Respiratory Syndrome,"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (also known as MERS or MERS-CoV) is a rare but severe respiratory illness. It can start with a fever and cough, which can develop into pneumonia and breathing difficulties. MERS was first identified in 2012 in the Middle East and is most common in that region. The risk of infection with MERS to people in the UK is very low.
How do you catch MERS? MERS is spread between animals and people. There's evidence that camels in the Middle East are the main source of the virus.MERS can also be passed from person to person through cough droplets. But it does not seem to be very contagious between people unless they're in close contact. There have been 5 cases of MERS in the UK since 2012. The most recent case was identified in August 2018, with previous cases diagnosed in 2012-13. 
Symptoms of MERS Symptoms include: fever cough difficulty breathing diarrhoea and vomiting You should call a GP or NHS 111 if you have symptoms and believe you could have caught the infection – for instance, if you have recently been to the Middle East or have been in contact with someone with a confirmed infection.
Treatment for MERS There's no specific treatment for MERS. Treatment aims to relieve the symptoms. Around 35% of people who get MERS die as a result of the infection. Advice to travellers going to the Middle East All travellers, particularly those with long-term medical conditions, should practise good hygiene. This means regularly washing your hands with soap and water, especially after visiting farms, barns or market areas. You should also: avoid contact with camels avoid raw camel milk and/or camel products avoid eating or drinking any type of raw milk, raw milk products, and any food that may be contaminated with animal secretions, unless it's been peeled and cleaned and/or thoroughly cooked Advice to travellers returning from the Middle East If you develop a fever, cough or difficulty breathing within 14 days of returning from the Middle East, you should get medical advice."
21,CDC,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html,Coronavirus,"People with COVID-19 have had a wide range of symptoms reported – ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness. Symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure to the virus. Anyone can have mild to severe symptoms. Possible symptoms include: Fever or chills Cough Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing Fatigue Muscle or body aches Headache New loss of taste or smell Sore throat Congestion or runny nose Nausea or vomiting Diarrhea 
This list does not include all possible symptoms. Symptoms may change with new COVID-19 variants and can vary depending on vaccination status. CDC will continue to update this list as we learn more about COVID-19. Older adults and people who have underlying medical conditions like heart or lung disease or diabetes are at higher risk for getting very sick from COVID-19.
Feeling Sick? If you are experiencing any of these symptoms, consider the following options: Get tested for COVID-19 If you have already tested positive for COVID-19, learn more about CDC’s isolation guidance. When to Seek Emergency Medical Attention Look for emergency warning signs* for COVID 19: Trouble breathing Persistent pain or pressure in the chest New confusion Inability to wake or stay awake Pale, gray, or blue-colored skin, lips, or nail beds, depending on skin tone If someone is showing any of these signs, call 911 or call ahead to your local emergency facility. Notify the operator that you are seeking care for someone who has or may have COVID-19."
22,CDC,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/testing.html,Coronavirus,"COVID-19 Testing: When you get tested: Make sure to test at the right time Choose the right type of test for your circumstance Follow test directions as recommended by FDA If you do not, your results may be less likely to correctly indicate whether you have COVID-19 or not.
Types of Tests Viral tests look for a current infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, by testing specimens from your nose or mouth. All tests should be performed following FDA’s requirements. There are two main types of viral tests:
Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) tests: PCR tests are the “gold standard” for COVID-19 tests. They are a type of nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT), which are more likely to detect the virus than antigen tests. Your sample will usually be taken by a healthcare provider and transported to a laboratory for testing. It may take up to 3 days to receive results.
Antigen Tests: Antigen Tests are rapid tests that usually produce results in 15-30 minutes. Positive results are very accurate and reliable. However, in general, antigen tests are less likely to detect the virus than PCR tests, especially when symptoms are not present. Therefore, a single negative antigen test cannot rule out infection. To be confident you do not have COVID-19, FDA recommends 2 negative antigen tests for individuals with symptoms or 3 antigen tests for those without symptoms, performed 48 hours apart. A single PCR test can be used to confirm an antigen test result.
When to Get Tested for COVID-19: If you have symptoms, test immediately. If you are only going to take a single test, a PCR test will provide a more reliable negative test result. If you use an antigen test, a positive result is reliable, but a negative test is not always accurate. If your antigen test is negative, take another antigen test after 48 hours or take a PCR test as soon as you can. If you do not have symptoms but have been exposed to COVID-19, wait at least 5 full days after your exposure before taking a test. If you are only going to take a single test, a PCR test will provide a more reliable negative test result. If you use an antigen test, a positive result is reliable, but a negative test is not always accurate. If your antigen test is negative, take another antigen test after 48 hours or take a PCR test as soon as you can. If your second antigen test is also negative, wait another 48 hours and test a third time. Testing can be helpful even when you don’t have symptoms or a recent exposure to COVID-19, such as before an event or visiting someone at higher risk.  Test as close to the time of the event as possible (at least within 1-2 days) to help you make informed decisions about your health and your risk of spreading COVID-19 to others. If you use an antigen test, follow recommendations for repeat testing to be confident in a negative result. Additionally, some places may test people without symptoms or a recent exposure to help keep COVID-19 from spreading to others, especially those who are at higher risk for severe illness.
After a positive test result, you may continue to test positive for some time. Some tests, especially PCR tests, may continue to show a positive result for up to 90 days. Reinfections can occur within 90 days, which can make it hard to know if a positive test indicates a new infection.  Consider consulting a healthcare provider if you have any questions or concerns about your circumstances.
Buy self-tests (at-home tests): Buy self-tests (at-home tests) online or in pharmacies and retail stores. Private health insurance may reimburse the cost of purchasing self-tests. Visit FDA’s website for a list of authorized tests. Self-tests are antigen tests.
Go to a testing location: Visit a community-based testing location, such as a pharmacy or health center near you. These locations may offer PCR or antigen tests, and provide low- or no-cost testing for everyone, including people without insurance. Free PCR or antigen tests may also be available through your local health department. Talk to a doctor or healthcare provider about other testing options that may be available to you. If you are a person with a disability, the Disability Information and Access Line can help you access a test or find a test location.
Interpreting Your Results If Your COVID-19 Test Is Positive Any positive COVID-19 test means the virus was detected and you have or recently had an infection. Isolate and take precautions, including wearing a high-quality mask or respirator, to protect others around you from getting infected. Tell people you had recent contact with that they may have been exposed. Monitor your symptoms. If you have any emergency warning signs, seek emergency care immediately. Contact a healthcare provider, community health center, or pharmacy to learn about treatment options that may be available to you. Treatment must be started within the first few days to be effective. You are more likely to get very sick if you are an older adult or have an underlying medical condition. Treatment is available. Talk with your healthcare provider to determine what is the best option for you.
If Your COVID-19 Test Is Negative A negative COVID-19 test means the test did not detect the virus, but this doesn’t rule out that you could have an infection. If you used an antigen test, follow FDA recommendations for repeat testing. If you have symptoms: You may have COVID-19 but tested before the virus was detectable. Consider that you may have another viral infection or illness that you need to get tested for. For many diseases, including flu, early diagnosis and prompt treatment is very important for preventing severe illness. Take everyday preventive actions to prevent spreading an illness to others. Contact a healthcare provider if you have any questions about your test result or if your symptoms worsen. If you do not have symptoms but were exposed to the virus that causes COVID-19, you should continue to take recommended steps after exposure. If you do not have symptoms and have not been exposed to the virus that causes COVID-19, you may return to normal activities. Continue to take steps to protect yourself and others, including monitoring for symptoms. Get tested again if symptoms appear. 
Testing for Antibodies: Antibody tests detect antibodies that your body makes to fight the virus that causes COVID-19. Antibody tests should never be used to diagnose a current infection with the virus that causes COVID-19. An antibody test may not show if you have a current infection, because it can take 1 to 3 weeks after the infection for your body to make antibodies. Antibody tests can be used for public health surveillance or to test for conditions associated with COVID-19."
23,CDC,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/treatments-for-severe-illness.html,Coronavirus,"COVID-19 Treatments and Medications: What You Need to Know: If you have COVID-19 and are more likely to get very sick, treatments are available that can reduce your risk of hospitalization and death. Don’t delay: Treatment must be started within days after you first develop symptoms to be effective. Other medications can help reduce symptoms and help you manage your illness. The Treatment Locator (hhs.gov) can help you find a location that offers testing and treatment or a pharmacy where you can fill your prescription. 
Treating COVID-19 If you have COVID-19 and are more likely to get very sick from COVID-19, treatments are available that can reduce your chances of being hospitalized or dying from the disease. Medications to treat COVID-19 must be prescribed by a healthcare provider and started as soon as possible after diagnosis to be effective. Contact a healthcare provider right away to determine if you are eligible for treatment, even if your symptoms are mild right now. Don’t delay: Treatment must be started within days of when you first develop symptoms to be effective. People who are more likely to get very sick include older adults (ages 50 years or more, with risk increasing with age), people who are unvaccinated, and people with certain medical conditions, such as chronic lung disease, heart disease, or a weakened immune system. Being vaccinated makes you much less likely to get very sick. Still, some vaccinated people, especially those ages 65 years or older or who have other risk factors for severe disease, may benefit from treatment if they get COVID-19. A healthcare provider will help decide which treatment, if any, is right for you. Check with your healthcare provider or pharmacist if you are taking other medications to make sure the COVID-19 treatments can be safely taken at the same time. Nirmatrelvir with Ritonavir (Paxlovid) Antiviral Adults; children ages 12 years and older Start as soon as possible; must begin within 5 days of when symptoms start Taken at home by mouth (orally) Remdesivir (Veklury) Antiviral Adults and children Start as soon as possible; must begin within 7 days of when symptoms start Intravenous (IV) infusions at a healthcare facility for 3 consecutive days Molnupiravir (Lagevrio) Antiviral Adults Start as soon as possible; must begin within 5 days of when symptoms start Taken at home by mouth (orally)
Some treatments might have side effects or interact with other medications you are taking. Ask a healthcare provider if medications to treat COVID-19 are right for you. If you don’t have a healthcare provider, visit a Test to Treat location or contact your local community health center or health department. If you are hospitalized, your healthcare provider might use other types of treatments, depending on how sick you are. These could include medications to treat the virus, reduce an overactive immune response, or treat COVID-19 complications. 
Convalescent Plasma Some people with COVID-19 who are immunocompromised or are receiving immunosuppressive treatment may benefit from a treatment called convalescent plasma. Your healthcare provider can help decide whether this treatment is right for you.
Managing COVID-19 symptoms person experiencing symptoms from COVID-19 infection Most people with COVID-19 have mild illness and can recover at home. You can treat symptoms with over-the-counter medicines, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil), to help you feel better. 
Preventing COVID-19 COVID-19 vaccines COVID-19 vaccines available in the United States effectively protect people from getting seriously ill, being hospitalized, and even dying. As with vaccines for other diseases, you are protected best when you stay up to date. CDC recommends that everyone who is eligible stay up to date on their COVID-19 vaccines.
The right medications for COVID-19 can help. People have been seriously harmed and even died after taking products not approved for use to treat or prevent COVID-19, even products approved or prescribed for other uses. Talk to a healthcare provider about taking medications to treat COVID-19.

24,CDC,https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/index.html,Influenza,"Influenza (flu) is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses that infect the nose, throat, and lungs. Some people, such as people 65 years and older, young children, and people with certain health conditions, are at higher risk of serious flu complications.  There are two main types of influenza (flu) viruses: types A and B. The influenza A and B viruses that routinely spread in people (human influenza viruses) are responsible for seasonal flu epidemics each year. The best way to reduce the risk of flu and its potentially serious complications is by getting vaccinated each year"
25,CDC,https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/disease/spread.htm,Influenza,"Person to Person: People with flu can spread it to others. Most experts think that flu viruses spread mainly by droplets made when people with flu cough, sneeze, or talk. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby (usually within about 6 feet away) or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. Less often, a person might get flu by touching a surface or object that has flu virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes. 
When Are People with Flu Contagious?: Flu viruses can be detected in most infected persons beginning one day before symptoms develop and up to five to seven days after becoming sick. People with flu are most contagious in the first three to four days after their illness begins. However, infants and people with weakened immune systems who are infected with flu viruses may be contagious for longer than seven days. Symptoms typically begin about two days (but can range from one to four days) after flu viruses infect a person’s respiratory tract. It is theoretically possible that before symptoms begin, an infected person can spread flu viruses to their close contacts. Some people can be infected with flu viruses and have no symptoms but may still be able to spread the virus to their close contacts."
26,CDC,https://www.cdc.gov/flu/treatment/treatment.htm,Influenza,"Antiviral Drugs: Most people with flu have mild illness and do not need medical care or antiviral drugs. If you get sick with flu symptoms, in most cases, you should stay home and avoid contact with other people except to get medical care. If, however, you have symptoms of flu and are at increased risk for complications, are very sick or worried about your illness, contact your health care provider. CDC recommends prompt early treatment for people who have flu or suspected flu who are at higher risk of serious flu complications, such as people with asthma, diabetes, or heart disease. Antiviral drugs can help treat flu illness: Antiviral drugs are different from antibiotics. Flu antivirals are prescription medicines (pills, liquid, intravenous solution, or an inhaled powder) and are not available over the counter. Antiviral drugs can make illness milder and shorten the time you are sick. They might also prevent serious flu complications, like pneumonia, when treatment is started early. It’s very important that antiviral drugs be started early after symptoms begin to treat people who are very sick with flu (for example, people who are in the hospital) and people who are sick with flu and have a greater chance of getting serious flu complications, either because of their age or because they have a higher risk medical condition. Other people also might be treated with antiviral drugs by their doctor. Most otherwise-healthy people who get flu, however, do not need to be treated with antiviral drugs. Studies show that flu antiviral drugs work best for treatments when they are started within two days of getting sick. However, starting them later can still be helpful, especially if the sick person has a higher-risk health condition or is very sick from flu (for example, hospitalized patients). Follow your doctor’s instructions for taking these drugs. 
If you get sick: Take Antivirals Drugs, if a health care provider prescribes them Take everyday precautions to protect others while sick While sick, stay away from others as much as possible to keep from infecting them. Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Throw the tissue in the trash after you use it. Wash your hands often with soap and water. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand rub. Clean and disinfect surfaces and objects that may be contaminated with germs like flu. Stay home until you are better If you are sick with flu-like illness, CDC recommends that you stay home for at least 24 hours after your fever is gone except to get medical care or for other necessities. Your fever should be gone without the use of fever-reducing medicine."
27,CDC,https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/about/symptoms.html,Respiratory Syncytial Virus,"Symptoms: People infected with RSV usually show symptoms within 4 to 6 days after getting infected. Symptoms of RSV infection usually include Runny nose Decrease in appetite Coughing Sneezing Fever Wheezing These symptoms usually appear in stages and not all at once. In very young infants with RSV, the only symptoms may be irritability, decreased activity, and breathing difficulties. Almost all children will have had an RSV infection by their second birthday. Call your healthcare professional if you or your child is having difficulty breathing, not drinking enough fluids, or experiencing worsening symptoms. 
Care: Antiviral medication is not routinely recommended to fight infection. Most RSV infections go away on their own in a week or two. However, RSV can cause severe illness in some people. Take steps to relieve symptoms Manage fever and pain with over-the-counter fever reducers and pain relievers, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen. (Never give aspirin to children.) Drink enough fluids. It is important for people with RSV infection to drink enough fluids to prevent dehydration (loss of body fluids). Talk to your healthcare provider before giving your child nonprescription cold medicines. Some medicines contain ingredients that are not good for children.
RSV can cause more serious health problems: RSV can also cause more severe infections such as bronchiolitis, an inflammation of the small airways in the lung, and pneumonia, an infection of the lungs. It is the most common cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in children younger than 1 year of age. Healthy adults and infants infected with RSV do not usually need to be hospitalized. But some people with RSV infection, especially older adults and infants younger than 6 months of age, may need to be hospitalized if they are having trouble breathing or are dehydrated. In the most severe cases, a person may require additional oxygen, or IV fluids (if they can’t eat or drink enough), or intubation (have a breathing tube inserted through the mouth and down to the airway) with mechanical ventilation (a machine to help a person breathe). In most of these cases, hospitalization only lasts a few days."
28,CDC,https://www.cdc.gov/pneumonia/causes.html,Pneumonia,"Causes of Pneumonia: Viruses, bacteria, and fungi can all cause pneumonia. In the United States, common causes of viral pneumonia are Influenza viruses Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) Common causes of bacterial pneumonia are Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) and, especially in kids, Mycoplasma pneumoniae. The bacteria and viruses that most commonly cause pneumonia in the community are different from those in healthcare settings. However, clinicians are not always able to find out which germ caused someone to get sick with pneumonia.
Defining Types of Pneumonia: Community-acquired pneumonia is when someone develops pneumonia in the community (not in a hospital). Healthcare-associated pneumonia is when someone develops pneumonia during or following a stay in a healthcare setting. Healthcare settings include hospitals, long-term care facilities, and dialysis centers. Ventilator-associated pneumonia is when someone gets pneumonia after being on a ventilator, a machine that supports breathing."
29,CDC,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/about/index.html,Middle East Respiratory Syndrome,"About MERS: Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) is an illness caused by a virus (more specifically, a coronavirus) called Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Most MERS patients developed severe respiratory illness with symptoms of fever, cough and shortness of breath. About 3 or 4 out of every 10 patients reported with MERS have died. All cases are linked to the Arabian Peninsula Health officials first reported the disease in Saudi Arabia in September 2012. Through retrospective (backward-looking) investigations, they later identified that the first known cases of MERS occurred in Jordan in April 2012. So far, all cases of MERS have been linked through travel to, or residence in, countries in and near the Arabian Peninsula. The largest known outbreak of MERS outside the Arabian Peninsula occurred in the Republic of Korea in 2015. The outbreak was associated with a traveler returning from the Arabian Peninsula. 
People with MERS can spread it to others: MERS-CoV has spread from ill people to others through close contact, such as caring for or living with an infected person. MERS can affect anyone. MERS patients have ranged in age from younger than 1 to 99 years old. CDC continues to closely monitor the MERS situation globally. We are working with partners to better understand the risks of this virus, including the source, how it spreads, and how to prevent infections. CDC recognizes the potential for MERS-CoV to spread further and cause more cases globally and in the U.S. We have provided information for travelers and are working with health departments, hospitals, and other partners to prepare for this."
30,CDC,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/about/symptoms.html,Middle East Respiratory Syndrome,"Symptoms & Complications: Most people confirmed to have MERS-CoV infection have had severe respiratory illness with symptoms of: fever cough shortness of breath Some people also had diarrhea and nausea/vomiting. For many people with MERS, more severe complications followed, such as pneumonia and kidney failure. About 3 or 4 out of every 10 people reported with MERS have died. Most of the people who died had a pre-existing medical condition that weakened their immune system, or an underlying medical condition that hadn’t yet been discovered. Medical conditions sometimes weaken people’s immune systems and make them more likely to get sick or have severe illness. Pre-existing conditions among people who got MERS have included diabetes cancer chronic lung disease chronic heart disease chronic kidney disease Some infected people had mild symptoms (such as cold-like symptoms) or no symptoms at all. The symptoms of MERS start to appear about 5 or 6 days after a person is exposed, but can range from 2 to 14 days."
31,CDC,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/about/transmission.html,Middle East Respiratory Syndrome,"Transmission: MERS-CoV, like other coronaviruses, likely spreads from an infected person’s respiratory secretions, such as through coughing. However, we don’t fully understand the precise ways that it spreads. MERS-CoV has spread from ill people to others through close contact, such as caring for or living with an infected person. Infected people have spread MERS-CoV to others in healthcare settings, such as hospitals. Researchers studying MERS have not seen any ongoing spreading of MERS-CoV in the community. All reported cases have been linked to countries in and near the Arabian Peninsula. Most infected people either lived in the Arabian Peninsula or recently traveled from the Arabian Peninsula before they became ill. A few people have gotten MERS after having close contact with an infected person who had recently traveled from the Arabian Peninsula. The largest known outbreak of MERS outside the Arabian Peninsula occurred in the Republic of Korea in 2015 and was associated with a traveler returning from the Arabian Peninsula. Public health agencies continue to investigate clusters of cases in several countries to better understand how MERS-CoV spreads from person to person."
32,CDC,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/about/prevention.html,Middle East Respiratory Syndrome,"Prevention & Treatment: Prevention: There is currently no vaccine to protect people against MERS. But scientists are working to develop one. You can help reduce your risk of getting respiratory illnesses: Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, and help young children do the same. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze, then throw the tissue in the trash. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands. Avoid personal contact, such as kissing, or sharing cups or eating utensils, with sick people. Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces and objects, such as doorknobs. If you are caring for or living with a person confirmed to have, or being evaluated for, MERS-CoV infection, see Interim Guidance for Preventing MERS-CoV from Spreading in Homes and Communities.
Treatment: There is no specific antiviral treatment recommended for MERS-CoV infection. Individuals with MERS often receive medical care to help relieve symptoms. For severe cases, current treatment includes care to support vital organ functions."
